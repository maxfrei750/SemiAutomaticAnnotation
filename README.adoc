This browser-based application allows the pixel-perfect annotation of objects, by just labeling their bounding box. It can therefore
yield significant speed-ups of the annotation process, especially for irregularly shaped objects.

== Deep-MAC versus Deep-MARC
Birodkar et al. proposed two models, Deep-MAC (Deep Mask-heads Above CenterNet) and Deep-MARC (Deep Mask-heads Above R-CNN). In this application, you can choose between the two models, however, for most particle analysis applications, they produce very similar results.

We compared the two models on a dataset of 32 grain images (with 3500+ grains) like the following one:

image::assets/images/grains.jpg[Grain image, width=30%]

The resulting masks were compared using the intersection over union (IoU) metric and by comparing their sizes.

=== IoU
The IoU is defined as the area of the intersection of the masks divided by the area of the union of the masks. The following figure shows a histogram of the IoU values for pairs of masks, produced by the two models.

The median IoU is 0.92 and 99% of the IoU are larger than 0.62, which indicates a high similarity between the masks produced by the two models. As an illustration, the following figures show corresponding IoU values.

=== Grain size
For this comparison, we used the square root of the number of pixels in the mask as a measure for the grain size. The following figures show histograms of the absolute (left), as well as relative (right) deviations of grain sizes between the two models:

The deviations were calculated as follows:

	size_deviation_absolute = size_deep_marc - size_deep_mac
	size_deviation_relative = size_deviation_absolute / size_deep_mac
