= Data folder structure

== `./input`
This is where you need to place the images that you are going to annotate.

== `./annotated`
After you have annotated an image, it is moved to this folder along with the associated `annotation_*.csv`-file . Also, the image is converted to a lossless `*.png`-file and renamed to have the prefix `image_`.

== `./output`
After an image with its annotations has been evaluated, both the `image_*.png`- and the `annotation_*.csv`-file are moved to this folder. The `mask_*.png`-files that results from the evaluation are also placed in this folder, along with a `visualization_*.png`-file of the detected objects.
